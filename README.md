### addon: [addon-contextmenu-recursive-expand-collapse](https://github.com/warren-bank/atom-tree-view-nodnd/tree/addon-contextmenu-recursive-expand-collapse)

#### Background

* "addons" are additional patches that are unrelated to "drag and drop"
* "addons" are organized in this repo: one per orphan branch

#### Summary

* this addon (_"addon-contextmenu-recursive-expand-collapse"_) adds an additional option to the context-menu for directories in the "tree-view"
  * when the directory is collapsed:<br>
    "Expand Directory and All Children"
  * when the directory is expanded:<br>
    "Collapse Directory and All Children"
* each of these commands is recursive,<br>
  and is applied to all sub-directories.

#### Requirements

* assumes that a version of "tree-view" is already installed as a "community package"
